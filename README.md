# 2DProfiler
# This is a tiny package on a 2D profiler run in Python 2.7
# Domeasurement.py reads S21 from N5230A, a type of vector network analyzer from Agilent Technologies.
# SingleMovement.py does a single movement on the profiler made by Zolix(卓立汉光). It is based on its Secondary development kit, which includes the dlls I use but not attached in this repository.
# mainprogram.py is a script that samples EM wave in a 2D plane.
